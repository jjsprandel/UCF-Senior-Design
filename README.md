## 💡 Overview
 **SCAN** is a low-cost, IoT-driven kiosk system designed to provide real-time analytics based on check-in and check-out information. By integrating NFC-based authentication, real-time data processing, and a user-friendly interface, SCAN provides users with a near-effortless check-in experience and provides facilities with actionable insights for improving operations. SCAN is able to track attendance and provide detailed analytics on occupancy trends, peak usage hours, and visit durations. These insights are accessible to administrator and facility managers via SCAN’s web application, which can provide them with the necessary statistics to allocate resources efficiently, optimize staffing, and improve user experiences.
